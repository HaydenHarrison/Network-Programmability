Hi! This repository is a collection of scripts I have used to configure or monitor network devices using Python. Most of these scripts were created in home lab environment, except for the daily status check script under the monitor section. This was a script I developed at work for general purpose administration and monitoring of Juniper network devices. I recreated the script and redacted sensitive information from the script, and pushed it to this repository as a text file.
